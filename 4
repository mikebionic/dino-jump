Dino Jump - Real Jump simulator implementation for chrome game.
A weekend project with an amazing constructor, Gali Dobrova.
A funny project went too far and deep in physics and architecture principles, to make it work right and flawless.. We surely could implement it in some other style, but we wanted to make them a jumping feel with these springs..
theoretically we just created another big human button.
